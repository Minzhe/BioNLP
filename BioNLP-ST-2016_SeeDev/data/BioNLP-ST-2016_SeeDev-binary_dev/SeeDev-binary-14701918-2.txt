The mature seed coat, in addition to forming a protective layer around the embryo, can play roles in such processes as seed
dispersal and germination. One adaptation believed to act in these processes is the production of mucilage in the epidermal
cells of the seed coat. This specialization, known as myxospermy, is found in many families, including the Brassicaceae, Solanaceae,
Linaceae, and Plantaginaceae (Grubert, 1981; Boesewinkel and Bouman, 1995). Seed imbibition in these plants leads to the formation of a gel capsule around the seed that is thought to aid hydration
and/or dispersal.
