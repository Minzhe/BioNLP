SAP18, a member of the core SIN3/HDAC complex, was recovered as an AGL15-interacting protein. The SIN/HDAC complex generally consists of eight proteins: SIN3, HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, RbAp48, SAP30, SAP18 and SDS3. However, yeast has only one HDAC, and lacks the SAP proteins (reviewed by Silverstein and Ekwall, 2005). Arabidopsis has two HDAC1 orthologs, HDA19 (At4g38130) and HDA6 (At5g63110), and the Arabidopsis ortholog of SAP18 has recently been shown to interact directly with HDA19 (Song and Galbraith, 2006). We show here that SAP18 is also able to interact with HDA6, and that AGL15 can directly interact with HDA19 (Figure 1). Although the C-domain alone is not sufficient to mediate an interaction between AGL15 and SAP18, it is necessary (FigureÂ 1).
