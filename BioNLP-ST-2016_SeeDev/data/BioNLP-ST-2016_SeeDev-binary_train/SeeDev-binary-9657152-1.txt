The Arabidopsis LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) gene is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. We isolated the LEC1 gene and showed that it functions at an early developmental stage to maintain embryonic cell fate. The LEC1 gene encodes a transcription factor homolog, the CCAAT boxâ€“binding factor HAP3 subunit. LEC1
RNA accumulates only during seed development in embryo cell types and
in endosperm tissue. Ectopic postembryonic expression of the LEC1
gene in vegetative cells induces the expression of embryo-specific
genes and initiates formation of embryo-like structures. Our results
suggest that LEC1 is an important regulator of embryo development that
activates the transcription of genes required for both embryo
morphogenesis and cellular differentiation.
